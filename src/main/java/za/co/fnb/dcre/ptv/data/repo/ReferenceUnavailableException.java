/**
 * TECHNICAL failure of a reference read: the datasource could not be reached, or the
 * relation the read names does not exist in this database. It is deliberately NOT a
 * {@code CtvOutcome}, because "I could not look" is not a finding about the payment.
 *
 * <p>SCRUM-107 repair 1. The account tier fails closed, so an EMPTY result now means
 * "this account is not in the reference store" and produces
 * {@code FAIL_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND}. That makes the two outcomes adjacent and easy to
 * conflate, and conflating them is the expensive direction: a failed read degrading to
 * an empty map would reject an entire arrival on the strength of a connection error,
 * while reporting business rejections an operator would act on. This type keeps them
 * apart at the type level rather than by convention.
 *
 * <p>It is a plain {@link RuntimeException} on purpose, NOT a
 * {@code TransientDataAccessException}: the platform's CRDB retry handler retries only
 * transient aborts, so this propagates on the first occurrence and fails the step, and
 * the job flow turns that into a FAILED job for AGT to relaunch. An absent relation is
 * not made present by five more attempts, and a datasource outage outlives the step's
 * backoff budget; halting loudly is the honest answer to both.
